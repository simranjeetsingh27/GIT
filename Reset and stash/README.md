## TO DO

### A developer is working on a feature on a branch, unfortunately he/she made a wrong commit. How would he/she recover from this situation without cleaning the working directory.

### You are working on a branch of a project. After modification, you thought that these modifications are quite less important but will work on later and for the time being, you should do some other implementation on the project using other branch. Is there any way to save your previous state of modification and get back it when required?
